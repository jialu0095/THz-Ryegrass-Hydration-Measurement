The overall aim of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring water 
status in ryegrass non-destructively using THz spectroscopy.

Data: 
THz spectroscopy measurements of ryegrass. 
Desired Output: 
a) THz spectroscopy measurements of a large variety of ryegrass plants with 
different morphology and genotype. 
b) Code-based automated analysis of the acquired data with insight into 
reproducibility and uncertainty analysis.
